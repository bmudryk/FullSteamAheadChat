Students will learn:
    * Coding environment and setup
    * How to leverage code written by others
    * Client-side vs Server-side code
    * Website styling - HTML, CSS, Javascript

Enhancement Ideas:
    * Broadcast when someone joins or leaves the chat
    * Remember session chat information
    * Create a login/password
    * Multiple chat rooms
    * Fancy CSS and animations
